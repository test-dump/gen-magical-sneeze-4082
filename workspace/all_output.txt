Let's begin with the entrypoint file. Since this is a console application in C#, there will be a Program.cs file with a static Main function which is the entrypoint. 

Program.cs
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Above is a simple "Hello, world!" console application. Now remember to compile and run it using your preferred development setup, such as using the Microsoft Visual Studio or .NET CLI.

When we compile and run Program.cs, it prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
